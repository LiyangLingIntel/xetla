## How to build and run gemm benchmark

### How to add a matrix shape
- add a new shape class like "class Test_xxx : public TestBase ..." in tests/integration/gemm/bf16/common.hpp
- add the Test "Test_xxx" to gtest list in tests/integration/gemm/bf16/main.cpp

### How to build and run
    tools/scripts/benchmark/build_run_gemm.sh

## How to build and run gemm + softmax benchmark
### How to add a matrix shape
- add a new shape MKN 4x4096x12288 and wg_tile_m 32, wg_tile_n 12288, sg_tile_m 32, sg_tile_n 512, sg_tile_k 32, like "gemm_softmax<32, 12288, 32, 512, 32>(4, 4096, 12288)" in examples/06_gemm_softmax/gemm_softmax.cpp

### How to build and run
    tools/scripts/benchmark/build_run_gemm_softmax.sh

## How to build and run softmax benchmark
### How to add a matrix shape
- add a test case like "mat1_4096x256_bf16_xxx" in tests/integration/softmax/softmax_config.hpp
- add the test "mat1_4096x256_bf16_xxx" like "softmax_fwd_run<mat1_4096x256_bf16_xxx>();" in tests/integration/softmax/softmax_fwd.cpp

### How to build and run
